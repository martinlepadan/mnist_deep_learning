# Deep Neural Network MNIST
This repo contains my code and all the elements I used to make a deep neural network which can recognize handwritten numbers (MNIST dataset).

This is my first machine learning project and couldn't be possible without the videos of Machine Learnia and Samson Zhang. 

It has an accuracy of ~90% but you can easily change the parameters (numbers of layers, neurons, epochs...) to improve the model at your ease. I used the ReLU function, which can be modified by the sigmoid function, for example. 

Lastly, I tried to make the model working with my own handwritten number, which worked, but with a lower accuracy.

Feel free to take this code and improve it like you want.
